### Business Goal

-A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as three things:
-Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
-Act as a  Learning record store (LRS), providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
-A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps

### technical requirements

-the backend will be made using go
-the database will be SQLlite 3
â€“the api will be built using GIN
-the api will return using JSON
-there will be no authentication or authorisaion 
-assume there is only a single user

 - group_id - integer 
 - created at date time 

-word_review_items - a record of word practice, determining if the word was correct or not.
 - id - integer 
 - word_id - integer 
 - correct - boolean 
 - study_session - integer
