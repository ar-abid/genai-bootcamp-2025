Let's work through the transcription together.
Vocabulary Table:
Romaji	Japanese	English
 kuma		        bear
 tobira		        door
 gomi		        garbage
 d asu		        to put out/take out
 deru		        to leave
 anata		        you
 kuchi		        (not used directly, but related word) dasu is better for this context

However for "did you leave the garbage out", dasu is a better fit.
For "are at the door", you might want to use the verb "iru" (to exist, to be) or a phrase that indicates location.
Additional vocabulary that might be useful:
Romaji	Japanese	English
iru		to exist, to be (for living things)
aru		to exist, to be (for non-living things)
Possible Sentence Structure:
Your sentence seems to be composed of two parts: a statement about bears and a question about garbage. In Japanese, you might structure this as two separate sentences or use a conjunction to connect them.
For the first part, "bears are at the door," a possible structure could be:
(Kuma wa tobira ni imasu).
For the second part, "did you leave the garbage out?", a possible structure could be:
(Anata wa gomi o dashimashita ka?).
Now, try to transcribe the sentence using the vocabulary and sentence structure clues. Don't worry if you make mistakes â€“ I'll help guide you through the process. What's your attempt so far?
